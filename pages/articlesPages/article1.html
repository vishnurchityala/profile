                  <h4 class="mt-3 mb-3">Part One</h4>
                  <h6 class="mt-3 mb-3">What is Zetwerk?</h6>
                  <p>
                    Zetwerk is an Indian based B2B start-up which offers various tech enabled services to streamline different stages in the supply chain. Their services like procurement, manufacturing and logistics management helps businesses and OEMs to reduce their efforts and problems by partnering with them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Amrit Acharya, Srinath Ramakkrushnan, Rahul Sharma and Vishal Chaudhary founded ZETWERK in 2018 as a SAAS company which acts as a marketplace for personalized manufacturers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The four founders are IIT graduates and founded the company with the sole intent to create a B2B business which manages the broken supply chain in the Indian economy with the help of their tech enabled solutions. Their company showed maturity within 30 days of its founding.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Their Marketplace offers a unified platform for manufacturers to list themselves in the platform and get their end customers from any remote location. Their platform started matchmaking between manufacturer and end customer.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    ZETWERK'S end customers were the businesses which built the infrastructure and other intensive structures. Unlike other e-commerce platforms Zetwerk sells goods like parts of cranes, chassis of vehicles, doors and different procured products.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In 2019 ZETWERK raised money from Greenoaks and Lightspeed investors about $32 million. After their first fund raise, they pivoted their business model and went a step back to become a procurement company themselves and provided the needed demand on their platform on their own. Which removed their issues with quality control of the goods purchased on the platform.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For becoming and manufacturer themselves they purchased companies which can cater the most demanded purchase on their platform and bought various companies like,
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Zetwerk acquired three companies first to strengthen its business in segments of oil, aerospace, defence and infrastructure components. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    After Their successful pivot from a SAAS company to an end-to-end supply chain management and procurement company they became profitable after three years of founding. Their revenue jumped from $110 million to $670 million in 2021-2022 from their previous year revenue. They are expecting to cross $1 billion revenue this year.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    ZETWERK in total have raised about $660 million dollars from various investors and their current valuation stands at $2.7 billion dollars.

                  <h4 class="mt-3 mb-3">Part Two</h4>
                  <h6 class="mt-3 mb-3">Why it is unique?</h6>
                  <p>
                    Founders of ZETWERK saw a great opportunity in the Indian manufacturing industry, they saw a broken supply chain between personalized manufacturers and buyers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Problems founders of ZETWERK saw in the current Manufacturing industry:-
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    One: 
                    Lack of contacts with small and medium scale buyers to manufacture their goods. Which caused businesses to face trouble in finding the right manufacturing partner to manufacture their desired products.

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Two:

                    Lack of Transparency between manufacturers and buyers. In today's e-commerce world even an order having value of 100 rupees has a feature and service to track their order in different phases.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Example:  If a person orders from Swiggy a cold milkshake gets an instant nudge of placing an order, then gets informed about the status of cooking and gets the live location of the delivery boy carrying their order.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If orders like food have transparency between two end polls, then why is there a lack of transparency between manufacturer and buyer where order value can reach up to hundreds of crores.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Three:
                    Quality control over the service provided by the manufacturer. In the Indian manufacturing industry it is common to have delays and getting low quality service to the order placed by buyers. The main reason for this is the lack of implementation of right technology and tech-enabled service in the industry. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Founders of ZETWERK entered into the industry with their online solution which acts as a bridge between manufacturer and buyers. They created an online matchmaking platform which matches both ends of manufacturing. Their platform gave a wide range of variety to buyers to choose as per their needs and gave scope to manufacturers to expand their business by getting orders from different remote places of the country.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    ZETWERK gave features to buyers to track their order and see the status of their order. By introducing this solution to buyers and customers ZETWERK eliminated the first two problems they saw in the manufacturing industry. Their solution showed the desired result they wanted, buyers were getting a wide range of manufacturers and manufacturers were getting orders from remote places. But, buyers were facing many issues in terms of quality of goods purchased from the platform and delays were a major issue in the order.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Due to problems of quality and time sensitivities feedbacks from buyers in the platform were not good. Many buyers had late delivery of their products and many had bad quality products. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To tackle this issue ZETWERK team restructured their business model in 2020 and went one step back and became manufacturer and procurer themselves, which will give them more quality and time control on the order placed on the platform. For this they bought 3 companies.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    They bought majority stakes in SHARP-TANKS which deals with oil and petroleum goods. PINAKA aerospace limited for goods in the defence sector and WHEELS-INDIA-LIMITED for goods related to railway infrastructure. These three companies were perfect to cater their on growing demand of the three products in their platform. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    After purchasing three companies ZETWERK now became a full-fledged manufacturer with an order of value more than $100 million in 2021. They coordinated three companies in such a way that all their goods purchased in the platform had excellent quality control and transparency between buyer and their order status had increased. By controlling all processes in the procurement and manufacturing ZETWERK had won the trust and built a loyal customer base using their services.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Institutions like BHEL, DRDO, ISRO, HAL, TATA, AVTEC and 10000 more companies have partnered with ZETWERK to get their goods and products. Bullet train project in India also placed order to get delivery of their required goods in the construction and they not only booked their orders in India but successfully attracted foreign OEM’s to purchase their service, about 16% percent of their revenue comes from out of India orders.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Overall the e-commerce platform which ZETWERK worked in started to create a humongous user base and contacts with the end customer which they can cater to, after they became manufacturer themselves it was easy for them to get customers and sell their products and services. After that ZETWERK bought supply chain management company UNIMACTS, they started selling their service in logistics management and supply chain management where they gave high end technology solutions to small scale and medium scale manufacturers to streamline their operations using their software and project management tools.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    After pivoting their business model they had shown a lot of growth and made their product market fit. Now their company valuation is approximately around $2.7 billion.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the whole journey of ZETWERK, the uniqueness of the company is in the space they entered and the solution they offered. Manufacturing industry in India has a potential to reach $1 trillion till 2025 but a major chunk of the industry is lacking in access to contacts and tech enabled solutions to smooth their processes. Founders saw a great opportunity and jumped into this old school industry and catered the best possible solution they could. Now they are not only helping Indian OEM’s to streamline the supply chain but are gathering a foreign direct investment to the country.
                  </p>
